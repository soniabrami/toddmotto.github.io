I often get asked what colour schemes I'm using, stuff for videos, workshops, slides and so forth. So this is essentially a quick write up on that stuff.

### Editor / Terminal

As a Developer Advocate, I don't have a typical engineering job, therefore my workflow isn't as likely refined as someone who's heads down engineering. However, prior to Dev Rel, I was a full-time engineer for around 6-7 years and used the same workflow/setup.

* [Atom Editor](https://atom.io) with default colour scheme
* [Operator Mono](http://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-operator) font

Atom stylesheet config:

{% highlight css %}
atom-text-editor::shadow {
  .entity.other.attribute-name {
    font-style: italic;
  }
}
atom-workspace,
atom-text-editor {
  font-family: 'Operator Mono';
  font-weight: 400;
  line-height: 1.7;
}
atom-panel.tool-panel {
  font-size: 1em;
}
{% endhighlight %}

* TypeScript packages
* Terminal package
* I do use [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/), however the Terminal package for Atom I find I switch between the two depending on how many processes are running.
* For Git stuff I use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) because I suck at command-line Git


That's literally it, I'm all for keeping it simple.

### Conference slides

* I used to use [Deckset App](http://www.decksetapp.com/) for all my slides
* Now I use, likely indefinitely, [Spectacle Boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate) to create all my slides in React/JSX
* Alongside Spectacle Boilerplate I run [Spectacle Codeslide](https://github.com/thejameskyle/spectacle-code-slide) for interactive code walkthroughs

### Desk and computer

* Laptops/Desktops: MacBook Pro 15" retina x 2, MacBook 12", iMac 27"
* Dock: I do own a [Henge Dock](https://www.hengedocks.com/) but it sucks and I never use it
* Sound system: [Bose 50](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00UF6XF2E/ref=pe_1909131_77697001_tnp_email_TE_AMZLdp_1) multimedia system on my desk, remote working noise #ftw
* Desk: [VariDesk Pro 54](http://uk.varidesk.com/en-gb/product/pro-desk-54) standing desk (huge workflow/comfort changer)
* Monitor: [34" curved LG](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01BFH1AIM/ref=pe_385721_137066351_TE_dp_1) 21:9 ultrawide (this has completely changed my working style, 100% recommend)

### Screencasts

* Microphone: Currently using the [Yeti](http://www.bluemic.com/products/yeti/) with popshield
* [Screenflow 2](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm) for recording and editing videos

### Other

* Spotify is my life long companion in getting stuff done :)
* Slack for procrastinating my life away

That's my entire setup! I keep it simple and easy.
